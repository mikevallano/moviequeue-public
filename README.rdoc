== README

This is an app that allows users to track movies they want to watch/have watched.. The goal is to create something where users can put movies they'd like to see in a queue and then mark them off and revisit that data later.

We'll be using http://www.omdbapi.com/ to populate any existing movie data (ratings, genre, artwork, etc.)
